# PemmicanSlowerDecay
Simple mod modifying a gear item for The Long Dark game made by Hinterland Studios.  
This mod only affects the cooked Pemmican bar, modifying the decay rate to a much lower value.  
The new, stronger Pemmican bar matches the outdoor decay rate of the cured meat.
Added a patch for Gear Decay Modifier mod by Romain to exclude Pemmican bars from that mod, because Pemmican is different than a rabbit pie!
