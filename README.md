# PemmicanSlowerDecay
Simple mod modifying a gear item for The Long Dark game made by Hinterland Studios.  
This mod only affects the cooked Pemmican bar, modifying the decay rate to a much lower value.  
The new, stronger Pemmican bar matches the decay rate of the cured meat. This means the decay rate is different in different difficulty modes, same as the cured meat.  
Added a patch for Gear Decay Modifier mod by Romain to exclude Pemmican bars from that mod, because Pemmican is different than a rabbit pie!
