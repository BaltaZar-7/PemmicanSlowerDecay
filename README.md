# PemmicanSlowerDecay
Simple mod modifying a gear item for The Long Dark game made by Hinterland Studios.  
This mod only affects the cooked Pemmican bar, modifying the decay rate to a much lower value.  
The new, stronger Pemmican bar matches the outdoor decay rate of the cured meat. (lasts longer indoors than the cured meat indoors)  
Added a compatibility patch for Gear Decay Modifier mod by Romain to exclude Pemmican bars from that mod.
